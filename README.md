# TenToken
My example personal token for Ethereum BlockChain with front end interface (React) to transfer "TenToken" and check balance of each accounts. Setup.txt has the key commands to setup blockchain.

An ERC20 sample token based on <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/token">Open Zeppelin</a>
